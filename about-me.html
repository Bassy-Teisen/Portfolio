            <h2>Paragraph</h2>
            <p>Before I began studying with Coderacedemy I had been a carpenter for 15 years; in that time, I have worked for a variety of employers and in a variety of roles. For the last three years of my carrier, I was self-employed with up to 4 employees at a time. Being self-employed was the greatest challenge and most rewarding time of my carrier. In this role I had to wear many hats. I had to be a businessman, finding future work and negotiate price. A project manager communicating with clients and managing deadlines. A supervisor managing the day to day of construction. Also, I had to be a teacher whilst training my apprentices. </p>

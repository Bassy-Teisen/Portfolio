            <p>Before I began studying with Coder Academy, I had been a carpenter for 15 years; in that time, I have worked for various employers and in a variety of roles. For the last three years of my career, I was self-employed with up to 4 employees at a time. Being self-employed was the most significant challenge and most rewarding time of my career. In this role, I had to wear many hats. I had to be a businessman, finding future work and negotiate prices. A project manager, communicating with clients and managing deadlines. A supervisor, managing the day to day of construction. Also, I had to be a teacher whilst training my apprentices. </p>
